  description: How to efficiently compute a shortest path graph containing exactly all shortest paths between any arbitrary pair of vertices on complex networks? Shortest path graph manifests itself as a basis for tackling various shortest path related problems, e.g., finding a rerouting sequence from one shortest path to another shortest path that only differs in one vertex and finding critical edges and vertices whose removal can destroy all shortest paths between two vertices.

  description: If a graph is dynamically changing over time, how can we efficiently find the shortest path distance between any two vertices? We propose an online incremental method to efficiently answer distance queries over very large dynamic graphs. We have empirically evaluated the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm over 12 large real-world networks.

  description: Many networks such as social networks often contain sensitive relationships among individuals, (e.g., friendships and acquaintances) or sensitive attributes of individuals (e.g., age, location and race). We develop a framework for publishing higher-order network statistics, i.e., joint degree distribution, under strong mathematical guarantees of node differential privacy.

  description: 2Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moir√© lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
