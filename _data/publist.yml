- title: "BatchHL: Answering Distance Queries on Batch-Dynamic Networks at Scale"
  image: SIGMOD2022-BatchHL.png
  description: Very recently, several batch-dynamic algorithms have been reported, mostly focusing on traditional graph problems such as graph connectivity, dynamic trees and k-clique counting. As of yet, batch-dynamic algorithms for shortest-path distance have been left unexplored, depsite that distance querying is a fundmental problem in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a batch-dynamic method, BatchHL, to dynamize distance labellings efficiently in order to reflect large batches of updates on a graph.

- title: "A New Perspective on How Graph Neural Networks Go Beyond Weisfeiler-Lehman?"
  image: ICLR2022-GraphSNN.png
  description: How to design expressive yet simple GNNs that can go beyond the WL test with a theoretically provable guarantee? We introduce a new hierarchy of local isomorphism to characterise different classes of local structures in neighborhood subgraphs, and discuss its connections with the WL test. We also develop a general solution to inject structural properties into a message-passing aggregation scheme, and theoretically characterize how GNNs can be designed to be more expressive beyond the WL test.

- title: "Fast Fully Dynamic Labelling For Distance Queries"
  image: JVLDB2021-HLFUL.jpg
  description: Due to the dynamic nature of real-world networks, such as social networks or web graphs in which a link between two entities may fail or become alive at any time, there is a pressing need to address the shortest path distance problem for dynamic networks. In this article, we propose a fully dynamic labelling method to efficiently update distance labelling. At its core, our method incorporates two building blocks for handling incremental update operations and decremental update operations, respectively.

  image: ICDM2021-RWF.png
  description: We propose a learning framework for graph kernels which is theoretically grounded on regularizing optimal transport. Regularized Wasserstein (RW) discrepancy can preserve both features and structure of graphs via Wasserstein distances on features and their local variations, local barycenters and global connectivity. Two strongly convex regularization terms are introduced to improve the learning ability. The framework is robust and can guarantee the numerical stability in optimization.

- title: "Beyond Low-Pass Filters: Adaptive Feature Propagation on Graphs"
  image: PKDD2021-ASGAT.png
  description: Many graph neural networks (GNNs) assume local homophily, i.e., strong similarities in local neighborhoods. This assumption however limits the generalizability power of GNNs. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible GNN model, which is capable of handling any graphs without being restricted by their underlying homophily.

Inspired by recent advances of generative adversarial networks, we propose a novel deep learning model for entity resolution called ErGAN. This model consists of two key components -- a label generator and a discriminator that are optimized alternatively through adversarial learning.

However, current learning-based active learning approaches still require sufficient training data so as to generalize meta-learning models for active learning. This is contrary to the nature of active learning which typically starts with a small number of labeled samples.
