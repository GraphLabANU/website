  image: SIGMOD2021-SPG.png
  description: How to efficiently compute a shortest path graph containing exactly all shortest paths between any arbitrary pair of vertices on complex networks? Shortest path graph manifests itself as a basis for tackling various shortest path related problems, e.g., finding critical edges and vertices whose removal can destroy all shortest paths between two vertices.

- title: "Efficient Maintenance of Distance Labelling for Incremental Updates in Large Dynamic Graphs"
  image: EDBT2021-IncUpdate.png
  description: If a graph is dynamically changing over time, how can we efficiently find the shortest path distance between any two vertices? We propose an online incremental method to efficiently answer distance queries over very large dynamic graphs. We have empirically evaluated the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm over 12 large real-world networks.

  image: PAKDD2021-dK-Project.png
  description: Many networks such as social networks often contain sensitive relationships among individuals, (e.g., friendships and acquaintances) or sensitive attributes of individuals (e.g., age, location and race). We develop a framework for publishing higher-order network statistics, i.e., joint degree distribution, under strong mathematical guarantees of node differential privacy.

  image: PAKDD2021-FSL.png
  description: Few-shot learning has attracted attention recently due to its potential to bridge the gap between the cognition ability of humans and the generalization ability of machine learning models. We propose Episode Adaptive Embedding Networks (EAENs), which leverage the probability distributions of all instances in an episode to extract representative episode-specific features.

  image: ICDM2020-ErGAN.png
  description: Entity Resolution is an important component of real-world applications in various fields. Inspired by recent advances of generative adversarial networks, we propose a novel deep learning method for entity resolution, called ErGAN. ErGAN consists of two key components: a label generator and a discriminator which are optimized alternatively through adversarial learning.

  description: We propose a novel spectral convolutional neural network model on graph-structured data, namely Distributed Feedback-Looped Networks (DFNets). This model is incorporated with a robust class of spectral graph filters, called feedback-looped filters, to provide better localization on vertices, while still attaining fast convergence and linear memory requirements.

  description: Answering exact shortest path distance queries is a fundamental task in graph theory. Despite a tremendous amount of research on the subject, there is still no satisfactory solution that can scale to billion-scale complex networks. We develop a highly scalable solution for answering exact distance queries over massive complex networks.
