  description: How to efficiently compute a shortest path graph containing exactly all shortest paths between any arbitrary pair of vertices on complex networks? Shortest path graph manifests itself as a basis for tackling various shortest path related problems, e.g., finding critical edges and vertices whose removal can destroy all shortest paths between two vertices.

- title: "Efficient Maintenance of Distance Labelling for Incremental Updates in Large Dynamic Graphs"
  image: EDBT2021-IncUpdate.png
  description: If a graph is dynamically changing over time, how can we efficiently find the shortest path distance between any two vertices? We propose an online incremental method to efficiently answer distance queries over very large dynamic graphs. We have empirically evaluated the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm over 12 large real-world networks.

  image: PAKDD2021-dK-Project.png
  description: Many networks such as social networks often contain sensitive relationships among individuals, (e.g., friendships and acquaintances) or sensitive attributes of individuals (e.g., age, location and race). We develop a framework for publishing higher-order network statistics, i.e., joint degree distribution, under strong mathematical guarantees of node differential privacy.

- title: "DFNets: Spectral CNNs for Graphs with Feedback-Looped Filters"
  image: NIPS2019-DFNets.png
  description: We propose a novel spectral convolutional neural network model on graph-structured data, namely Distributed Feedback-Looped Networks (DFNets). This model is incorporated with a robust class of spectral graph filters, called feedback-looped filters, to provide better localization on vertices, while still attaining fast convergence and linear memory requirements.
