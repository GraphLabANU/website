### Current projects

Below are some projects that we currently work on:

**Deep Learning for Graph Isomorphism.** Graph isomorphism is a fundamental concept for exploiting the structure of graphs. This project aims to develop new heuristic techniques and theories for graph isomorphism, advancing state-of-the-art methodologies for its applications in solving real-world problems. Inspired by recent advances in machine learning, this project will investigate graph isomorphism problems from a deep learning perspective by marrying the best approaches from classic graph isomorphism studies with new techniques from modern AI. This is an important step towards bridging the gap between combinatorical generalization and deep learning.

Below is an example of an isomorphism between two graphs, which is the mapping: 1 &#x2192; A, 2 &#x2192; B, 3 &#x2192; F, 4 &#x2192; E, 5 &#x2192; G, 6 &#x2192; C, 7 &#x2192; I, 8 &#x2192; D, 9 &#x2192; H (practical problems can have millions of vertices):

**Geometric Graph Learning.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

Below is the t-SNE visualization of the 2-D node embedding space for the Pubmed dataset by applying our Distributed Feedback-Looped Networks (DFNets):

**Shortest-Path Algorithms**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.
