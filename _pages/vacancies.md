#### 2. ARC Discovery Project PhD opportunities: "Deep Learning for Graphs" ####

[PDF version]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/phd-scholarships-2021.pdf)

Supported by a grant from the Australian Research Council, we are currently looking for new PhD students with passion, talent and grit to join the team. You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges at the intersection of deep learning and graph theory. You will be involved in discussing important and interesting questions in this challenging area, developing new heuristic techniques and theories to advance state-of-the-art methodologies, and evaluating their applications in solving real-world problems. Each PhD student will have their own PhD project under the joint supervision of Prof. Brendan McKay and A/Prof. Qing Wang, and may collaborate on other related projects in the team.	


**Scholarship information** <br />

Two PhD scholarships are available, each including a living allowance of $28,597 per annum with a waived tuition fee, in accordance with the standard of ANU University Research Scholarships. The successful applicants will be supported by the scholarship for 3.5 years.
